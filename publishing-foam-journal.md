# Publishing Foam: Journal

- Analisys paralysis is keeping me from starting to write my thoughts, so I don't want to spend a lot of time fiddling with the published website; having content is much more important in this early stage.
- At first I considered using the default foam template, because it is the option with the least friction.
- But I already know some of the features I would like my published website to eventually have, so if I found a template that is easy to install and have those, it would be nice.
- Some of these features are:
  - Dark theme
  - Search
  - Backlinks
- The templates that caught my attention were:
  - foamy-nextjs
    - I'm interested in learning Next.js, that's what I liked about this
    - It has MDX support, which is nice
    - But the website is very barebones: no dark theme, no search, no backlink
    - [[Maybe]] I'll reconsider using it when I decide to dive into personalizing the website
  - foam-mkdocs-template
    - I really like the looks and the structure:
      - navigation on the left
      - Table of Contents on the right (that even highlights the current section, which is great!)
    - It also has a nice built-in search
    - I haven't tried to, but customization seems simple enough, so maybe I could add the Dark Theme without much effort
    - Unfortunatelly, no out-of-the-box backlink support
  - foam-gatsby-template
    - I'm not a big fan of Gatsby, but my opinion is mostly "impression-based", so I might give it a try
    - It has dark theme, search **and** backlink!
    - The page stack thing is also nice
  - Therefore, I've decided to start with the latest. [[Foam Gatsby Template: Journal]]
  - In the same day, I found another gatsby template: foam-template-gatsby-kb
