# Foam Gatsby Template: Journal

- Merged foam-gatsby-template into master
  - Had to use flag `--allow-unrelated-histories`
- Opened `_layouts/gatsby-config.js` and edited the `pathPrefix` to be vitorvanacor.github.io
- Pushing to master triggered the Github Action that builds the site and deploys it to `gh-pages` branch
- In the repo Settings: Changed the Github Pages configuration to use the `gh-pages` branch instead of `master`
